# Lego EV3 4D Gantry
The MicroPython programs for my 4D gantry robot

This is where I will publish all my free to use micropython programs involved in my large automated Lego warehouse. (This one is for the 4D gantry)

Basic version uses:
- 1x EV3 controller with PyBricks MicroPython
- 3x EV3 large motor
- 1x EV3 medium motor
- 1x EV3 Touch sensor
- 2x EV3 25cm cable
- 3x EV3 35cm cable

Extended version with conveyor and color sensor uses:
- 1x EV3 controller with PyBricks MicroPython
- 3x EV3 large motor
- 1x EV3 medium motor
- 1x EV3 Touch sensor
- 1x EV3 Color sensor
- 2x EV3 25cm cable
- 3x EV3 35cm cable
- 1x Custom 150cm EV3 cable
- (optional rechargeable EV3 battery charging cable to put in energy chain)
- (optional programming cable to put in energy chain)

 1 MicroPython program is running at a time;
- 4D_gantry_basic (Basic version without a conveyor belt and no color sensor)
- 4D_gantry_color_sensor (Extended version with a small conveyor belt for feeding pins, uses an EV3 color sensor and a custom EV3 cable 150cm long)
- Future updates: 4D gantry with small bins for storing sorted pins, and unload them with pneumatics or springs.


All my programs/machines are just made for fun and demonstrating what plastic bricks are capable of doing.
